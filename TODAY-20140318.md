#### Browser Package Management - Guy Bedford

https://github.com/guybedford

https://twitter.com/guybedford

used [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) for modularity

- easy to share code between apps
- require.js configuration is a massive pain
  - very repetitive
  - not easily shared

can we do better?

goal: open web browser and start developing, no need for users to install package manager

ES6 Module Specification: `import`

[ES6 Module Loader Polyfill](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader)

> Dynamically loads ES6 modules in NodeJS and current browsers.

`traceur.js`: compiles ES6 into ES5

how can this replace require.js?

[systemjs](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)

> Spec-compliant universal module loader - loads ES6 modules, AMD, CommonJS and global scripts.

AMD: Asynchronous Module Definition

demo'd Voxel engine:

- browserify bundle much faster load than jspm.io, but much slower compile time

discussed use of SPDY push

> SPDY & HTTP/2 really can replace bundling

#### 60 FPS or Bust: Bleeding Edge Web Animation - Jeremy Kahn

> I am not an animator

> Animation is a really powerful communication tool

CSS gives us transitions (reactive) and animations (active)

via JavaScript: `setTimeout()`, `requestAnimationFrame()`

awesome combination: triggering CSS transition via JavaScript

[Web Animation at Work by Rachel Nabors](http://alistapart.com/article/web-animation-at-work)

Leverage the GPU

`translateZ(0)`-- lots of folks like to use this, but it's not standardized

not a lot og video RAM on mobile, easily to max out

pipeline between CPU and GPU is relatively slow

optimize by only animationg `opacity` and `transform`

##### Nick Howard: Higher Order Functions In 120 Seconds

- callbacks
- `map()`

this is applicative

you can also have functions that return functions

and functions that are input functions and return functions, *ie.* combinators

[`allong.es`](http://allong.es/): collection of combinators

##### middleman for javascript builds

http://middlemanapp.com/

ruby gem

uses sprockets

based on manifests

##### 3-D

exposes a lot of the power of WebGL

#### You should be using Twitter's Flight framework. - Kassandra Perch

http://kperch.github.io/mtn_west/

http://twitter.github.io/flight/

- set of small utilities
- encourages well-written, modular apps
- lightweight
- not MV*
- plays well w/ other libraries
- gives you tools to structure your code

commandments of Flight

- components are atomic
- communication vie events
- use the DOM
- test everything

big on functional mixins

Gang of Four: value object Composition over Inheritance

steps

1. write your html
2. write your JS component code
  - `this.defaultAttrs({})`
    - allows easy overrides without changing class
  - `this.after('initialize', function(){})`
  - Event handlers, listeners
3. run `.attachTo(selector)`

Flight provides utilities needed for testing code:

- components = tiny little services
- each service has a consistent API
- jasmine-flight, mocha-flight
- wrappers:
  - set up `EventSpies`
  - automate HTML markup injection
  - headless test running


Flight plays well w/ other libraries, *e.g.* Ember, AngularJS, etc.

how to add Flight to your code:

- put event handlers in your existing code
- put event triggers in your existing code

#### [Error Handling in Node.js](https://cloudup.com/iHRjZbVdiFz) - Jamund Ferguson

https://twitter.com/xjamundx

node.js error stacktraces can be cryptic

"This is Open Source. It's someone else's problem." ;)

wrong: "It's always your problem."

had problems w/ node.js app crashing, lots filling up disk, bringing down production server.

`try {} catch {}`...

can't `catch` in ajax

best practices:

- catches
- callbacks
- custom errors
  ```javascript
function MountainError(message) {
   Error.captureStackTrace(this);
   this.message = message;
   this.name = "MountainError";
}
MountainError.prototype = Object.create(Error.prototype);
```
- conventions
  - always deel in Error objects
  - `callback(error)` or `next(error)` the immediately `return`
  - `process.on('uncaughtException')` must always `process.exit`
  - consider using a helper function and creating a standard schema for sending errors to the client
  - log every error
  - don't `throw` unless you can't do anything else

#### Traces of Errors: Getting Better JavaScript Stacktraces - Todd Gardner

Cofounder of Track:js

https://github.com/toddhgardner

https://twitter.com/toddhgardner

Error specification
- `Error(message, file, line, ...)`
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error

different browsers have different error objects

> anonymous functions kill traceability of stack traces

- [stacktrace.js](http://stacktracejs.com/)
- tracekit.js
- zone.js

#### gulp: The next generation build system - Eric Schoffstall

https://github.com/Contra

Creator of Gulp

http://gulpjs.com/

http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/

> Make is not optimized for modern web development

Grunt is task based

- not good for build systems
  - not performant
  - lack of context between transformations

streams

- unix: `|`
- node `.pipe()`

Gulp is file and stream-based

- very node like
- no DSL to learn

max concurrency

> tasks can have dependencies (other tasks), and gulp keeps a tree of these

gulp has three basic functions

- `gulp.task(name, function)`
  - callbacks, promises or streams
- `gulp.src(globs)`
  - takes in globs, emits matched files
- `gulp.dest(folder)`
  - writable stream

takeaways:

- code is more terse
