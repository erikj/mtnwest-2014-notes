# Trip Report: MountainWest Hackweek 2014

I had the privilege of attending the [2014 MountainWest Hackweek](http://mtnwesthackweek.org/2014) in Salt Lake City, Utah, March 17-21.

Hackweek conducted in an auditorium @ the Salt Lake City Public Library, a beautiful and modern facility, and was composed of three separate conferences: a two-day JavaScript conference, a one-day DevOps conference and a two-day Ruby conference.

My notes from this conference are available @ https://github.com/erikj/mtnwest-2014-notes. Video of presentations should be available @ [Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com/videos) within a few weeks of the conference.

## Misc Observations

It appeared that there were as many presentations using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) as Keynote, and they looked great. This is notable and promising for those of us who prefer to use familiar Web technologies over WYSIWYG presentation editors and opaque proprietary or binary formats.
