#### Be predictable, not correct - Pete Hunt

What makes UIs difficul to build?

- Human-werified
- Lots of state
- Tooling mismatch
- Lots of complexity

> The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible. - http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra

Make UIs reliable

Use data binding

> Our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible. - http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra

Contemporary data binding isn't simple

> Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability - Dijkstra

> What matters for simplicity is that there's not interleaving - Rich Hickey (Author of Closure)

Most popular data binding: key-value observation
- [ember](http://emberjs.com/guides/object-model/bindings/)
- [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-syntax.html)
- backbone

Angular - still complicated

what if our javascript was reactive?

DOM is stateful! (boo!)

Virtual DOM: a less leaky abstraction

[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html)

Every system has constraints

Data binding not analyzable

Mobile: memory is just as important as CPU

KVO book-keeping is not free

Render code is usually cheap

Your view is usually smaller than your model (if not, your app is already fast)

reactive is better due to O(n)

for complicated data views, views < models

=> O(v) < O(m)

Virtual DOM only keeps track of what's rendered

How to solve performance problems w/ Virtual DOM? caching / memoization

#### Unshackling JavaScript with Macros - James Long

Mozilla, Sweet.js, ASM.js

[Sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org/): macro system for JS

[Stop Writing JavaScript Compilers! Make Macros Instead
](http://jlongster.com/Stop-Writing-JavaScript-Compilers--Make-Macros-Instead)

syntactical abstraction + functional abstraction

```javascript
macro foo {
  rule { $x plus $y} => {
    $x + $y
  }
}
5 plus 6 // =< 5 + 6
```

can do pattern matching via set of `rule`s

`let` macros to override built-ni keywords

####  Asynchronous JavaScript at Netflix - Jafar Husain

member of [TC39](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm)

Design Patterns, focus today on Iterator and Observer patterns

Observer pattern: producer iterates you

Events and Arrays from *both* collections

JS6: replace function declarations w/ `=>`

Observable == Collection + Time

Observable `concatAll`: reliably flattens events in the order that their calls were assigned

"Nowadays, I don't think in terms of events, I think in terms of collections"

http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx/

https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS

#### Adding Even More Fun to Functional Programming With RXJS - Ryan Anklam

Senior UI engineer @ Netflix

@bittersweetryan (twittre, github)

functional review:

- `map`: transforms data
- `filter`: narrows colletions
- `reduce`: turns a collection into single value
- `zip`: combines two collections

reactive flatting patterns:
- `merge`
- `[concat](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/doc/api/core/observable.md#rxobservableconcatargs)`
- `switchLatest`

"at Netflix, we only try to manipulate data within `forEach` loop"

#### Using TDD to Tame the Big Ball o' Mud - Brandon Hays

https://twitter.com/tehviking

works @ http://frontside.io/

[Big Ball of Mud Architecture](http://laputan.org/mud/)

paths away from the ball of mud:

- more idiomatic JS
- lean on a frameowork

use models to manage data

get out of the DOM asap

at his company, they mode code into Ember

test framwork: [JSpec](https://github.com/liblime/jspec) (*The JSpec library is no longer being supported. We recommend taking a look at Jasmine*)

Identify models (may or may not match server-side models)

use states to avoid manipulating the DOM

#### Test-Driven Development of Ember.js Applications - Andy Pliszka

works @ Pivotal Labs

http://antityping.com/

https://twitter.com/antityping

Chrome extension for Ember

walking through development of TODO app

- node
- yeoman
- bower
- mochai/chai

Jasmine is used for most Pivotal projects

https://github.com/AntiTyping/EmberDo

"this is pretty much of a copy of the AngularJS talk that I gave a few months ago"

"So, how does AngularJS compare w/ Ember?" ...


#### And benchmarks for all! - Alex Navasardyan

member of Ember release-management team

https://twitter.com/twokul

https://github.com/twokul

Benchmarking is hard:

- assembly
- C++ (JS engines and compilers)
- Javascript: frameworks, browsers, etc.
- Hardware

JS Compilers:
- spidermonkey (Firefox)
- Chakra (IE)
- VB (Chrome)
  - **speaking about mostly V8 today**
    - https://developers.google.com/v8/design

Why write benchmarks?
- understand
- improve
- measure & validate

Compilers create hidden classes.

Benchmarking Patterns:

- may have drawbacks due to garbage collections, compiler optimizations, etc.

Use a library:
- [benchmark.js](http://benchmarkjs.com/)
- http://jsperf.com/

#### Bringing the Web Back to the Blind - Ryan Florence

works @ Instructure

https://github.com/rpflorence

https://twitter.com/ryanflorence

accessible - easily to be obtained or used

study showed that it takes average blind user 11 minutes to find the day's weather

interfaces:

- screen readers
- braille displays
- screen magnification
- custom color transforms or stylesheets
- keyboard only
- mouse only
- dictation
- closed caption
- head guides

landmarks / tag attributes

- `role`
- `aria`

only going to talk about screen readers

CSS: hide from screen readers via `visibility: hidden`

HTML5Boilerplate, display on in ScreenReader:

- `.visuallyhidden`
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14876754/bootstrap-equivalent-of-html5boilerplates-visuallyhidden

- Screenreaders all execute javascript

WAI ARIA

- http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA

*"Audible Interaction Design"*

*"When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don't consider the bloody ROI."* - [Tim Cook](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s)

#### [JavaScript SEO (the "right" way)](http://jeffwhelpley.com/javascript-seo/) - Jeff Whelpley

https://github.com/jeffwhelpley

https://twitter.com/jeffwhelpley

works @ GetHuman

how does Google rank pages?

1. Inbound links
2. No pogosticking
  - going back and forth between results page and visited pages
3. performance: every millisecond matters
  - GetHuman shoots for:
    - 200ms server load
    - 2s page load
4. Social proof: discussion on social media
5. On-page SEO

Single-Page Applications (SPA) typically return empty body

solutions that don't work well

1. fragments, yuck, bad URLs: `/#!/...`, https://github.com/jeffwhelpley
2. cloaking: show different page to crawlers. Google hates this-- sites can be banned.
3. Headless browsers suck for assessing SEO
  - http://phantomjs.org/
4. only a tiny fraction of sites are using fragments

what is the answer?

server-side pre-rendering

- who does this?
  - Twitter
  - isomorphic JS:
    - React (Facebook)
    - Ember

#### JavaScript: A Gateway Language, or, Why You Should Teach Your Kids JavaScript - Liz Abinante

https://github.com/feministy

https://twitter.com/feministy

JavaScript has many flavors, you get to pick one

*"The earlier you learn, the more you can learn in a lifetime"*

adults are inhibited by our own fears

adults lack the imagination of childhood

why not ruby or python?

- complex system set up
- not as visual as JavaScript
- a little syntax is good for the soul, grounding
- introduces kids to the web

how to

- increase in complexity as each child learns
- bring programming principles into daily life:
  - conditionals
  - arrays
  - data structures
  - loops

requires spatial and logical reaoning, which doesn't kick in until around age 13

keep lessons short
