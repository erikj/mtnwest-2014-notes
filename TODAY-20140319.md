### [Day Three: DevOps](http://mtnwestdevops.org/2014/schedule)

#### Modern DevOps: Understanding the Terrain - Mitchell Hashimoto

started HashiCorp, A DevOps tools company

- Vagrant
- Packer
- [Serf](http://www.serfdom.io/)

discussing Serf @ this talk

Application lifecycle:

- development, want:
  - readily available
  - make changes, see changes
  - consistency
    - want to avoid: "well, it works on my machine"
  - collaboration and sharing
- deployment
  - run on test, staging or production
  - start / configure servers
  - deliver / run application
- maintenance: keep everything running and changing
  - monitoring
    - anticipate and react to problems before they become big problems
  - updating
    - OS
    - libraries
    - application
  - orchestrating

DevOps covers cultural and technical

covering technical today

Goal: make the *application lifecycle* more efficient

How to do this? **Tools**

- reduce human error
- increase repeatability
- codification of knowledge
- faster

> you need more than a hammer to build a house

**tour of tools**

development

- vagrant
  1. clone project repository
  2. `vagrant up`
  3. ready to work
  - consistency via compartmentalized VM
  - shareable: `vagrant share`, `vagrant connect`

deployment

- slightly more complicated
  - ./configure
  - chef, puppet
  - [packer](http://packer.io)
    - optimizes slow parts of server set up by creating images
      - DevOps has historically been against images
        - hard to apply changes to running image
          - led to move to modern CM
        - benefits
          - super-fast infrastructure deployment
          - stability, testability
      - able to build images for everything using every CM tool

maintenance

- common goal: change w/ resiliency to failure
- one way to do this: **Serf**
  - manages membership, lets you know when membership changes
  - [gossip](http://www.serfdom.io/docs/internals/gossip.html)-based membership
    - every node checks a random node
    - broadcasts checked node's status to cluster
  - custom events
  - result: resilient to failure, near instant notification

#### What your Mother never told you about Automating Security - Jason Rohwedder

https://github.com/jro/automated_security

> Security is hard. Be methodical. It takes time.

secure hosting: Firehost

network security:
- physically controlled network
- logically isolated network: VLAN / VPC
- internal VPN
- SSL all the things

network access:
- host-based access
- firewall management apps
- AWS - security groups
- AWS-VPC subnet ACLs

host firewalls
auto-firewall: fail2ban

Dos / DDoS protection:

bouncer, CloudFlare, etc.

Bastion host
- gateway to your production environment
- limited services, *e.g.* ssh and vpn

SSH: use keys, not passwords

- key store: chef vault

sudo: use it

use 2-factor on your bastion host: no excuses!

software: automatic updates

- pin / freeze critical or unreliable packages
  - *e.g.* databases, MySQL, etc.
  - [cloudpassage](http://www.cloudpassage.com/)

OS hardening: selinux, sysctl

IDS

encrypt resting data

> in the cloud, we don't know where our hard drives are going to go after they leave our EC2 instances

encrypt backups
- tarsnap

centralized logging: rsyslog, loggly, splunk

static anaylsis, Rails: brakeman, code climate, veracode
- requires reaonable test suite in place

host vulnerability scanning: qualys, nessus

web app vulnerability scanning: whitehat sentinal, Qualys WAS

fixing things: [Risk I/O](https://www.risk.io/)

#### The Immutable Pipeline - Chris Gaffney

works @ Collective Idea

immutable (compiled) machine images

pipeline:
- compile
  - they use Packer
  - everything else is done in chef (solo)
  - goal is to set up something that never requires chef to be run again
- test
- destroy

> an image is a macro compiled bootable collection of code

testing: black box, rspec, HTTP calls via [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday)

deploy to staging continuously

#### How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love DevOps - Bridget Kromhout

works @ 8thBridge, *"Social Discovery for Commerce"*

old-school sysadmin, said 'no' a lot

not the best way to relate to developers

joined a Dev team as an the Ops person

culture matters: cooperation, not competition

mention of Slack chat: https://slack.com/is/team-communication

measure everything, *e.g.* Graphite

*"It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory"*. [W. Edward Deming](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/w/w_edwards_deming.html)

#### Introduction to Docker - James Turnbull

> Containerization is the new virtualization

http://dockerbook.com/

LXC has been around since Linux 2.6

Docker

adopted concept from Solaris

- easy and lightweight way to model reality
- devs care about their app, ops cares about containers
- golden images w/o the overhead

why not VMs or Cloud

- speed of deployment
- portability
- size aka cached layering FTW
- density & performance
- cost-- VMWare is expensive @ scale

libcontainer replaces lxc

docker images can be sourced from public or private registries

images are composed of layers and their deltas

> Docker 1.0 is to be released next month

http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/terms/layer/

#### Automating cloud factories and the internet assembly line with SaltStack - Thomas Hatch

primary author of Salt

[Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/community/): automation platform

Salt is fast: engineered for communicating w/ large groups of systems

- based on 0MQ: super fast
- SSH for certain use cases, 50x faster than other SSH-based tools
- [RAET: Reliable Asynchronous Event Transport](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/development/raet/index.html)

deployment philosophy: *"Don't have pets, have cattle."*

testing salt: http://jenkins.saltstack.com/

- tests on every commit pushed to github
- spin up VMs on Rackspace to run tests using Salt Cloud
- based on Docker images

Hulu uses Salt due to its orchestration capabilities, also found it was easier to learn and maintain, migrated from using Chef

#### Cooking at Shopify: Taming a busy kitchen with many Chefs - Phil Cohen

they use [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/)

Graphite, DataDog

managed by Chef:

- Vagrant
- Cooker (internal tool)
  - environments
  - data bags
  - testing platform
- Staging
- Production

use Chef Knife like other people use Rake

> fail forward

#### Bridging the DevOps Islands with Pantry - Jason Roelofs

http://pantryops.org/

https://github.com/pantry

Jason works @ Collective Idea

- DevOps Pipeline / Automation Framework
- Convention Over Configuration
- Pantry itself is not a configuration tool

maintaining separate chef cookbooks for separate clients, gets hard maintaining security updates, etc.

can't share cookbooks across chef organizations

berkshelf found to be unreliable

state of DevOps: lots of custom development still required

different DevOps communities are like separate islands

common new stack questions

- where do I store my data?
- how do I provision new servers?
- how do I configure the servers?
- how do I share configurations?
- how do I keep all of this secure?

Pantry is meant to answer these questions in a common way...

Pantry is a gem

based on:

- Ruby 2.0
- ZeroMQ
- libsodium
- CurveZMQ for cypto, improved implementation of CurveCP
   - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519
   - used for encryption between clients and servers

pantry aims for remove the tedium from DevOps

#### I Serve No Master! - Aaron Gibson

https://github.com/biggiemac/mtnwest_prez

http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/

not running puppet in its traditional role w/ a puppet master

likes to identify and eliminate silos

"if it can't be repeated, it doesn't count" (bus factor)

applied puppet to address problems @ Adaptive

certificates / signing was a pain point

made their own tool: builder

- wrapper for puppet
- written in bash
- modular
- can be automated, called from jenkins
- pluggable
- one tool to rule...


#### "DevOps" in a Post-DevOps World - Paul Reed

http://www.slideshare.net/jpreed/mtnwest-devops2014

podcast: http://theshipshow.com/

> Has DevOps jumped the shark?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin

when working on complex problems, there are no *"best practices"*, *ie.* best implies one, only *"good practices"*

self-awareness:

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hangry

VIDS:
- value realignment
- individuality
- don't be an asshole
- self awareness / systems thinking

> DevOpsâ€™ classical CAMS: culture, automation, metrics, and sharing
