### [Ruby, Day One](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/2014/schedule)

#### A Magical Gathering - Aaron Patterson

> Let’s roll up our sleeves, and learn about Ruby and OpenCV. Let there be coding. Let there be learning. But most of all, let this be the most magical of all gatherings. I’ve put on my robe and my wizard hat, now lets make magic happen!

https://github.com/tenderlove/magic_scan

wanted to assess value of his Magic-Card collection

equipment: laptop, webcam

scraped magic website for card names and images

technologies

- opencv
- ruby promises
  - Promise = Thread
- needed to limit Promises via Thread pool
- scraped website, then discovered magic-JSON site
  - search google first
- image matching via perceptual hashing
  - http://www.phash.org/
  - provides hamming distance
- 25000 cards
- added hamming_distance function to SQLite3
- calculated phashes for all 25k cards
  - only using one cpu core
  - patched library to use threads
- OpenCV is extremely poorly documented
  - https://github.com/tenderlove/ruby-opencv
  - http://rubyforge.org/projects/opencv/

- challenges:
  - webcam time to focus
  - similar cards
  - cat keeps moving stuff around

#### Generate Parsers! Prevent Exploits! - Nick Howard

> theory of computation is relevant to web development! (maybe)

what do exploits have in common? unexpected computation

exploits aren't tricks, they're computational machines

1. take input
2. do stuff
3. profit

same as usual programs

exploits
- make use of undocumented behavior

to prevent exploits, validate inputs

- e.g. railsxml yaml exploit from  2013

recognize input

theory of computation

- decidability
  - for certain types of input, decidability is proven impossible
- [chomsky hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy)
- recognize inputs before parsing them
  - [langsec](http://langsec.org)
    - turing complete inputs
    - don't parse xml w/ reg ex
      - reg ex for regular languages
      - xml not regular language
      - html has tiny little xml parse for sanitizing html
        - still, rails parses things too early
          - should parse in our application, to avoid undefined behavior
  - rails has input validation
    - Rails 3: attr_accessible
      - minuses: definition and usage in different places
    - better: Rails 4 strong parameters
      - minuses: silently strips out bad keys => undefined behavior

[muskox](https://github.com/baroquebobcat/muskox): schema-based parser generator
- only allow valid strings to be parsed

#### Introduction to CRuby source code - Andy Pliszka

https://speakerdeck.com/antityping/introduction-to-cruby-source-code-mwrc

Pivotal NYC

advantages:
- rewrites parts of your code in C
  - 10-50x faster
- C Extensions

rvm builds ruby from scratch

level 1: do it ourselves:

    $ brew install openssl
    $ autoconf
    $ ./configure ...
    $ make
    $ make check # runs tests
    # export paths: GEM_HOME, etc.
    $ gem install rails # another verification of ruby

level 2: install debugger

- *e.g.* [lldb](http://lldb.llvm.org/)

level 3: C-ruby source code

- define ruby method: `rb_define_method()`
  - two step process:
    - associate name w/ method
    - assign method in C
- two worlds:
  - C: working direclty w/ memory, malloc
  - Ruby: working w/ heaps

level 4: hacking C

- need to make sure methods return object

is it safe in production? No! To use: extract into a gem.

#### New Ruby 2.1 Awesomeness: Pro Object Allocation Tracing - Sam Rawlins

https://github.com/srawlins/reveal-mwrc14

http://srawlins.github.io/reveal-mwrc14/#/

`ObjectSpace.trace_object_allocations`

https://github.com/blog/1489-hey-judy-don-t-make-it-bad

> ```ruby
GitHub.preload_all
GC.start
count = ObjectSpace.count_objects
puts count[:TOTAL] - count[:FREE]
#=> 605183
```
> Whelp! More than 600k Ruby objects allocated just after boot!

http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/ObjectSpace.html

http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/objspace/rdoc/ObjectSpace.html#method-c-trace_object_allocations

diagnostic tool

[allocation_stats gem](https://github.com/srawlins/allocation_stats)

> Tooling for tracing object allocations in Ruby 2.1

https://github.com/srawlins/rack-allocation_stats

`String#freeze`
- only assigns static strings on first pass => faster

#### The Other Junk Drawer: My Tests are a Mess - Christopher Sexton

Goal: organization

real goal: write code that you understand when you come back to it in six months

priority: team meetings "new feature or clean up test suite?" answer is always: 'new feature'

intent: pay attention and know when to stop

habit: always test

what to test

- acceptance tests
- unit tests
  - [Sandi Metz: The Magic Tricks of Testing](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2452-railsconf2013-the-magic-tricks-of-testing)

- act
- arrange
- assert

[Mise en Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place): Puts your toys away as you go.

test directory structure should mirror application's directory structure

group logically: puts related thingsg close together

manage setup: very carefully

#### Unpacking Technical Decisions - Sarah Mei

https://speakerdeck.com/sarahmei/unpacking-technical-decisions-mountain-west-ruby-conf-2014

evaluation techniques:

- accessibility
  - do you identify w/ the style of the code?
  - Angular is built by Java developers, *e.g.* uses dependency injection
  - Ember: built by Rails developer, based on a router
  - "library / framework authors are turning the way they they think into code"
- interface
- popularity
- activity

#### Re-thinking regression testing - Mario Gonzalez

http://ortask.com/

mutation testing

> code coverage is unreliable. tells you what your tests cover right now, but not in the future.

mutation score = mutants killed / total mutants

pillars:
- competent programmer hypothesis
- coupling effect

test redundancy is a smell: likelihood of bugs is correlated w/ test redundancy

mutation analysis tools
- ~~heckle~~ obsolete as of Ruby 1.9
- [mutator](https://github.com/ortask/mutator)

#### Big O in a Homemade Hash - Nathan Long

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem

looking up array element by index is `O(1)` because array index => memory address

in Ruby, hashes trade memory for speed

every ruby object has a digest value via `.hash`:

    ruby-2.0.0-p247>> 1.hash
    => 584893079030193297
    ruby-2.0.0-p247>> -1.hash
    => -3572310634111773259

- Hashes are `O(1)` multi-tool
- Dyanamo DBs (Riak, Cassandra) are distributed has tables

demo code: https://github.com/nathanl/demo_hashes

#### Don't. - Ernie Miller

https://speakerdeck.com/erniemiller/dont

> We all know that intelligent species learn from mistakes, right?

> There’s just one problem: Life is too short to make every possible mistake! Also, some mistakes are more costly than others.

- don't get comfortable
- don't try to be someone you're not
- don't be afraid
- don't be afraid to say 'no'
- don't be afraid to share
- don't be afraid to speak
- don't be afraid to stretch

#### lightning talks

http://www.boastr.net/

don't use slides that are black text on white background

finding dead code

- use new relic or [appneta](http://www.appneta.com/)

##### trust-driven development

http://www.noelrappin.com/trdd/

- say you're going to do something and do it
- don't be afraid of responsibility
