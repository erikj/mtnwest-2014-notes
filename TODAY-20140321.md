#### Affordances in Programming Languages - Randy Coulman

> An affordance is a property of an object, or an environment, which allows an individual to perform an action. For example, a knob affords twisting, and perhaps pushing, while a cord affords pulling. - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance

API design can have affordances

enumberables can take `.none?` message:
http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-none-3F

[sapir-whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity)

> Languages are not only tools to communicate, but tools to think, Matz, **The Power and Philosophy of Ruby**, OSCon 2003

[RAII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization) pattern from C++: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

Ruby doesn't have deterministic destructors, but it does have blocks

> `b → str` click to toggle source
> Returns a copied string whose encoding is ASCII-8BIT. - http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-b

#### A World Without Assignment - Aja Hammerly

http://www.thagomizer.com/files/no_assignment_mwrc_14.pdf

one core principle of functional programming: no assignment

functional programming is easier to test

always start from a known state

scheme basics:

- prefix notation: `(+ 5 3)` => `8`
- functiona
- conditionals
- lists
- recursion
- anonymous functions: `lambda` in ruby and scheme-- ruby was **really** influenced by scheme

ruby's `.include?()` is called `member` in every other language

if you do javascript, you should really learn functional programming

logging:
- logstash
- graylog2
- apache kafka
- amazon kinesis
- fluentd

clustering
- make big parts into smaller parts
- [k-means clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering): group anything that can be plotted on an x-y chart

#### Test Driven Neural Networks with Ruby - Matthew Kirk

https://www.dropbox.com/s/kysyro1aq5dq79p/Machine%20Learning%20Techniques.pdf

> Data is the new bacon

> Ruby is not a "Big Data" language

> Ruby has plenty of tools

> Ruby is not about complex math

[feed-forward neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network)

- fuzzy logic
- activation functions: take any input and output value between zero and one
- complicated weighting function

#### The Timeless Way of Building - John Athayde

https://speakerdeck.com/boboroshi/the-timeless-way-of-building-mwrc

http://pragprog.com/book/warv/the-rails-view

[design patterns book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) written during time of static-typed languages. we have patterns already implemented in ruby, *e.g.* iterator pattern: `.each`

christopher alexander:
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Experiment

principles are pattern, *e.g.*
- DRY
- YAGNI
- SRP
- OCP
- LSP
- ISP
- DIP
- => SOLID

> Patterns all the way down.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Engineers_Know_and_How_They_Know_It

antipatterns

- big ball of mud
- walking the tree, / train wrecks
  - better: composition, delegation
- fat models
  - better:
    - modules
    - concerns
    - plugins
    - gems
    - engines
- callbacks
- rails is a series of a very large libraries
- complex finders
  - better: scopes
- generators
- DSL all the things
- good: typographic rendering
- good: MVC
- untested code
- fat controllers
- good books:
  - rails antipatterns
  - design patterns in ruby

> Patterns, like all forms of compexity, should be avoided until they are absolutely necessary - http://blog.codinghorror.com/head-first-design-patterns/

Patterns "remind us of what we already know" - Christopher Alexander

#### But Really, You Should Learn Smalltalk - Noel Rappin

http://www.pharo-project.org/home

arrays are 1 based

1. The Purist OO Language
2. Live Dynamic Environment
3. A Road Not Taken: not heavily influenced by C

http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X

development is Smalltalk-browser based (*e.g.* Pharo)

> To be truly object oriented, a system must provide automatic storage management (both data and code) - Dan Ingalls, 1981, Byte Magazine


> MagLev is a fast, stable, 64-bit open source implementation of the Ruby programming language and libraries built on top of VMware’s GemStone/S 3.1 Virtual Machine.

#### CRUD! The Consequences of Not Understanding How ActiveRecord Translates into MySQL - Eileen Uchitelle

works @ PhishMe

"If you don't know what phishing is, I'll send you an email w/ some links to click on"

Phishing => large datasets

read:

- `.find_each` more memory friendly
- `.pluck`

#### Software Development Lessons from the Apollo Program - Julian Simioni

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks

before Unix

lesson: handle failure gracefully

they did unit testing

software was easy to test, all functional programming

lot of integration testing, loved it.

MIT retrospective
- hard problems:
    - making schedules, how to meet them
    - knowing specs of other tests
- integration testing was very beneficial

unit test prove your code
integration tests prove your code's communication

working w/ ~~users~~ astronauts
- astronauts, like all users, didn't know what they wanted
  - distrustful of automation
    - didn't want automated reentry, but only used manual reentry once
